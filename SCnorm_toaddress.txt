## Stuff that we need to address in the paper:

1. Several assumptions made when analyzing bulk RNA-seq data to not apply in the context of scRNA-seq 
(e.g., that most genes are not DE between samples)
--Assumptions that bulk methods make.
		Less than 50% DE
--What are our assumptions?
		Groups are pre-defined.

2. Data normalization strategies must be designed to capture sources of bias that are specific to each technology.
--Sequencing Depth applies to all
--Others may need to adjust for other effects.


## Stuff to do :

1. SCnorm on their simulation setup, how does it work? Is it strong enough evidence?

---looks good, running now.
