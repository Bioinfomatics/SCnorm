## Latest Update:

The latest update removes the prior option of PLOT and replaces it with option of SavePDF. SCnorm will automatically generate evaluation plots and by default (SavePDF = TRUE) these are written and saved to the current or given directory. Turning SavePDF=FALSE will print plots to screen or current device.
